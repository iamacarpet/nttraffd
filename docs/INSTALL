The installation of nttraffd requires two parts:
    * A single server instance.
    * nttraffd client daemon.

To view your bandwidth logs, you will also need our grapher script.

The server is a PHP script with a MySQL backend and as such needs to be run by a webserver supporting those.

For best performance and reliability I recommend using Apache2 with PHP5 set up as a FastCGI.

Server Installation
=====================

1. Create a MySQL database and user for the nttraffd scripts to use.
2. Run init.sql from the server_src folder against the database.
3. Copy index.php from the server_src folder into the place you want it to run from.
4. Edit the top of the file to contain your correct MySQL details.

That is your server set up correctly.

Client Installation
=====================

1. To build this package on Ubuntu 10.04, you will need to run - apt-get install build-essential libcurl-dev
2. cd into the src directory and run: make && make install
3. Copy nttraffd.conf from the etc directory into /etc and edit to match your server and auth details (see adding a client).
4. Run it with the command nttraffd

The nttraffd daemon can usually be run as a non-privileged user.
When running a grsec kernel, the daemon will need to be run as root.

To start the client on boot:

1. Copy etc/init.d/nttraffd to your /etc/init.d folder.
2. Make sure it's executable: chmod 755 /etc/init.d/nttraffd
3. Make it run on boot with: update-rc.d defaults nttraffd

Graph Viewer Installation
=====================

1. Copy the ttgraph.php file from the viewer_src folder to where you would like it to run from.
2. Edit the MySQL details at the top of the page to reflect your server installation.
